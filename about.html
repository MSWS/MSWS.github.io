  <p>
    I am a Computer Science student working towards a B.S at Western Washington University. I started programming
    with Minecraft-related projects (Java). Since those humble beginnings, I've expanded my knowledge with
    websites (HTML, JavaScript, CSS); Source Servers (SQL, Server Administration, Docker, CI/CD); and Games (Python,
    Java/Typescript, Serialization). I am currently working on Linear Algebra and basic CSC Prerequisites. I plan on
    minoring in Mathematics while at WWU, and am excited to apply the knowledge to the <i>real world</i>.
  </p>
  <p>Outside of CS, I enjoy playing Chess, videogames such as CS:GO or Minecraft, and even sleeping.</p>
