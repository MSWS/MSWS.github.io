    <h3>Who am I</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science Student working towards a B.S at Western Washington University.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What am I doing</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently working on Linear Algebra and basic CSC pre-requisites. I plan on minoring in Mathematics while at
      WWU, and am excited to apply the knowledge to the <i>real world</i>. I'm also volunteering in communities such as
      <a href="https://edgegamers.com">EdgeGamers</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>What have I done</h3>
    <p>I started programming with <span>Minecraft</span> projects (Java). Since those humble beginnings, I've expanded
      my
      knowledge with <span>websites</span> (HTML, JavaScript, CSS); <span>Source Servers</span> (SQL, Server
      Administration, Docker, CI/CD); and <span>Games</span> (Python, Java/Typescript, Serialization). <br></p>
    <br>
    <p>Outside of CS, I enjoy playing Chess, videogames such as CS:GO or Minecraft, and even sleeping.</p>
